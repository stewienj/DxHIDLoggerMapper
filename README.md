# DxHIDLoggerMapper
Windows Keyboard, Mouse, and Joystick logger that uses DirectX to read the inputs. Typically used for monintoring reaction times and steadiness in human performance experiments.

An additional project has been added that allows for mapping of inputs from one device to another device. Currently in basic form. Needs to be fleshed out with user configurability, and have multiple outputs from a single input.
